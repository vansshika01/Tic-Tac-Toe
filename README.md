# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game
Welcome to Tic Tac Toe, a simple and fun game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 🎉 The game features a classic 3x3 grid where two players take turns to mark their symbols ("X" or "O"). The objective? Be the first to line up three of your marks—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally! 🤩

🚀 How to Play
1. Starting the Game
The game starts as soon as you open the page! Players alternate placing their mark ("X" or "O") in one of the nine available squares on the grid. 😎

3. Winning the Game
A player wins by getting three marks in a row—either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Can you be the first? 🥇

5. Draw
If the grid fills up and no player wins, the game ends in a draw! 😬 No worries though, there's always next time!

7. Resetting
Once the game ends, simply click the "Reset Game" button to clear the board and start a new round with the same player sequence! 🔁
If you're ready to completely reset and start fresh, click the "New Game" button and let the fun begin again! 🎉

🎉 Enjoy playing Tic Tac Toe and may the best player win! 😄🎉
